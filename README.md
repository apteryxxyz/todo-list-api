# TODO List API

## Usage

Once started and Swagger has opened in your browser, you should see this:

![Swagger UI](https://i.ibb.co/0tkL9Zw/Backend.png)

The first endpoint you would want to use is labelled `[ PUT ] /api/lists`. Enter a name for your todo list then press `Execute`. In the response body will be a list ID (`id`) and a key (`key`). You can then use those two strings to use the remaining endpoints.
